# Fight sequence

1. Players Collide
2. Both players back off and locked for the duel. A virtual circle appears.
3. Max dice **M** is determined by the player with less dice slots. **M** is at most 10.
4. In 3 seconds, both players choose and throw at most **M** dice
   1. If not chosen, random dice are chosen
   2. Those dice enter cooldown and cannot be used for a while.
5. The damage is assessed and applied:
   1. The player with more **speed symbol** is going to attack first
      1. If the number of speed symbols are the same, then both damages are assessed at the same time
   2. Damage calculations:
      1. Raw damage: A is going to take damage of (B.Sword + B.Buff.Sword - A.Shield - A.Buff.Shield)
      2. Bleed: if A takes damage at all, A will also take bleed damage if A has Bleed Debuff
   3. When taking damage:
      1. If the player has 1 dice left, 
      2. if all dice are in cooldown, a random die from all dice is destroyed.
      3. a non-cooldown (?) die will be destroyed.
      4. When a dice is destroyed, the opponent gains XP for upgrades
6. All buffs are then cleared.
7. Add buffs according to rolled dice:
   1. **Books** add temp Sword Buffs to self
   2. **Venom** add Venom Debuff to opponent
   3. If you have more **Morale** than opponent, add x temp Shield buff to self, where x = Morale difference
8.  If all dice are in cooldown, reset their cooldown
9.  The winning player has 1~2s of immobility, able to be challenged but cannot move


# Fight Sequence Alternatives

1. long-press a direction to throw a ball of 3 dice
2. whether it hits a player or not, it goes to cooldown.
3. if you roll a shield, you gain temp shield until before the next throw.
4. if sword hits opponent, they will take damage like above


# Upgrading

1. When players stand close to pop-up stores, they can buy stuff by spending xp.
   1. Eg: add slots up to 10
   2. Buy temp sword and shield
   3. Sell dice for xp
